[500 internal server error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) can be frustrating after deploying an application,  this was the case when I deployed a `laravel` application via shared hosting. 

After deploying the project,  I was getting a 500 internal server error ,  after much checks here and there,  I was able to resolve it

What I did was to change the PHP version in my c-panel to a higher version, after doing that,  my project become live... 

I hope you find this resourceful
