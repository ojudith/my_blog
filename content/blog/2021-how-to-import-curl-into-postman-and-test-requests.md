## What is Curl?

[Curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

## Steps

The following steps can be used to test Curl in Postman:

 - open postman.
 - click on the **import**  tab on the top left side.
 - select the **raw test tab**.
 - paste the raw text, then click **continue**.
 - confirm the **name** , **format**  and **Import as** 
 -  if  step **5**. is correct, click **import.**


This automatically imports Curl into Postman.
