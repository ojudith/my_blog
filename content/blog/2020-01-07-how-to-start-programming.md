Over the past few years, a lot of folks have become more interested in technology especially the programming aspect, but they seem not to know how to start. Well if you are one of them or you happen to know somebody who is, kudos!!! you have found the right article.

[Programming](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming) is the process of taking an [algorithm](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/algorithm.html) and implementing it with a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) to proffer a solution. These process are carried out by individuals otherwise known as [Programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) who are equipped with skillsets that enable them carry out various task in web, mobile, artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL)/ machine learning (ML), and what have you.

So how do you get started:-

**\#1 BE PASSIONATE:** Yeah! You have to be passionate about it because this goes a long way to help you through all the hurdles that comes along and also help you to become better. When it seems as thou you want to quit, the passion will overshadow it and keep you moving.

**\#2 MAKE RESEARCH:** With easy access to internet and portability of your mobile phone, you can check out the different areas or careers in programming and draw a conclusion on what you want to venture into.
